notes: "The Bonne map (chromo-topographical map of the Kingdom of the Netherlands on the scale of 1:25,000) was originally produced between the end of the 19th and the start of the 20th century. The Map Room has one series which covers the entire country. The year of publication is as close to 1900 as possible. The maps have been georeferenced and can be read in Autodesk Map or other GIS software with the correct coordinates. The files are provided in GeoTIFF format.</br>\r\n\r\n<!-- break -->\r\n\r\nThe map sheets are not available online.
