title: Bonne maps
organization: Delft University of Technology
notes: "The Bonne map (chromo-topographical map of the Kingdom of the Netherlands on the scale of 1:25,000) was originally produced between the end of the 19th and the start of the 20th century. The Map Room has one series which covers the entire country. The year of publication is as close to 1900 as possible. The maps have been georeferenced and can be read in Autodesk Map or other GIS software with the correct coordinates. The files are provided in GeoTIFF format.</br>\r\n\r\nThe map sheets are not available online. Use the form below to request (parts of) the digital map files from the TU Delft Library Map Room.</br>\r\n\r\nFor the original prints of the Bonne maps you can go to the Trésor of the TU Delft Library. \r\nTo surpass others is fucking tough, if you only do as you are told you don’t have it in you to succeed. Learn from fucking criticism. You are not your fucking work. This design is fucking brilliant. If you’re not being fucking honest with yourself how could you ever hope to communicate something meaningful to someone else? Never, never assume that what you have achieved is fucking good enough. Don’t worry about what other people fucking think. Someday is not a fucking day of the week. Respect your fucking craft. Think about all the fucking possibilities. Form follows fucking function. Creativity is a fucking work-ethic. Sometimes it is appropriate to place various typographic elements on the outside of the fucking left margin of text to maintain a strong vertical axis. This practice is referred to as exdenting and is most often used with bullets and quotations. Design is all about fucking relationships—the relationship of form and content, the relationship of elements, the relationship of designer and user. Practice won’t get you anywhere if you mindlessly fucking practice the same thing. Change only occurs when you work deliberately with purpose toward a goal. Nothing of value comes to you without fucking working at it. Make your work consistent but not fucking predictable. When you sit down to work, external critics aren’t the enemy. It’s you who you must to fight against to do great fucking work. You must overcome yourself. Must-do is a good fucking master. Can we all just agree as the greater design community to stop fucking talking about Comic Sans altogether? It’s getting fucking old. If you fucking give up, you will achieve nothing. The graphic designer’s first fucking consideration is always the size and shape of the format, whether for the printed page or for digital "
